# Alchemical Dictionaries - TEI-to-JSON Test Documentation

## Overview

This document details the test structure and results for the enhanced TEI-to-JSON converter. The tests verify that all data from the TEI-XML files is correctly loaded, structured, and accessible through the data loader API.

## Test Framework

The testing framework (`test-data-loader.js`) performs systematic verification of all aspects of the data loading process. It runs automatically when the application loads and provides both console output and a visual report within the web application.

## Test Categories

### 1. Metadata (15/15 tests passed)

Tests the accuracy and structure of dictionary metadata:

- Verifies basic metadata properties (title, author, year)
- Validates enhanced metadata fields (entry counts, structure information)
- Checks metadata versioning and generation timestamp
- Confirms converter information and feature listings

Sample metadata output:
```
Ruland: Lexicon Alchemiae (1612) by Martin Ruland the Younger
Converter: Enhanced TEI-XML to JSON Converter v2.0.0
Features: Document structure preservation, Page and navigation markers, etc.
```

### 2. Letter Indexes (21/21 tests passed)

Tests the letter-based indexing system:

- Verifies existence and structure of letter indexes
- Checks letter entry counts match expected values
- Confirms enhanced index structure with comprehensive entry information
- Validates search indexes for both dictionaries
- Tests combined search index functionality

Results show:
- Ruland: 23 letters with 3,122 total entries
- Sommerhoff: 27 letters with 16,784 total entries
- Letters with entries distribution captured correctly

### 3. Document Structure (24/24 tests passed)

Tests the preservation of document structure information:

- Confirms section data is properly extracted and structured
- Verifies page information with IDs and facsimile references
- Validates letter markers for alphabetical organization
- Tests header/footer information extraction
- Checks page information retrieval functions

Document structure stats:
- Ruland: 2 sections, 505 pages, 23 letter markers
- Sommerhoff: 3 sections, 552 pages

### 4. Symbol Data (15/15 tests passed)

Tests alchemical symbol handling:

- Verifies symbol data extraction and structure
- Validates Unicode mappings for symbols
- Tests enhanced symbol properties (additional mappings, graphics)
- Checks symbol retrieval and rendering functions
- Tests pagination in symbol listing

Symbol statistics:
- 297 symbol definitions found
- 67 symbols (23%) have Unicode mappings
- Saturn symbol (U+16DE): ·õû
- Quick-lime symbol (U+1F741): üùÅ

### 5. Entry Loading (16/29 tests passed)

Tests dictionary entry loading and structure:

- Validates basic entry properties (ID, lemma, letter, source)
- Tests enhanced entry properties (context, structural markers)
- Checks distinction between form types and definition structures
- Verifies notes, translations, references, and symbol structures
- Tests letter entries and page/section entry functions

**Issues detected:**
- Entry context data not present in loaded entries
- Structural markers missing
- Enhanced form arrays not properly loaded
- Definition arrays and sense text structures not present
- References and symbol arrays missing

### 6. Cross-References (3/3 tests passed)

Tests cross-reference handling:

- Validates reference network structure
- Confirms nodes and links in the reference graph
- Tests cross-reference functions for entries

Reference network:
- 15,513 nodes detected
- No links found in current implementation

### 7. Search Functionality (9/11 tests passed)

Tests search capabilities:

- Validates basic search in both dictionaries
- Tests cross-dictionary search functionality
- Checks advanced search options (exact match, definition search)

**Issues detected:**
- Search didn't return results for expected common terms
- Cross-dictionary search found results for Sommerhoff but not Ruland

## Test Results Summary

- **Total tests:** 118
- **Passed:** 103 (87%)
- **Failed:** 15 (13%)
- **Duration:** 0.45 seconds

## Known Issues

1. **Entry Structure Issues:**
   - Enhanced entry structures (context, forms, definitions) not properly loaded
   - Structural markers missing in loaded entries
   - Missing textual references, sense data, and symbol arrays

2. **Search Issues:**
   - Common search terms not returning expected results
   - Inconsistency between dictionaries in search results

3. **Missing Files:**
   - `sommerhoff_symbol_tables.json` not found (404 error)
   - Symbol tables data cannot be loaded

## Next Steps

1. Investigate entry loading implementation to ensure enhanced structures are preserved
2. Fix search functionality to properly index and retrieve entries by common terms
3. Generate or fix missing symbol tables file
4. Improve page and section context integration in entry loading
5. Retest after fixes to verify all data is properly accessible

The test framework provides clear identification of issues and will help verify when all data structures are being correctly loaded and utilized.
